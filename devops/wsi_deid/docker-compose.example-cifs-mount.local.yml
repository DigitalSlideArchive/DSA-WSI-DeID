      # contains at least two lines:
      #   username=<cifs user name>
      #   password=<cifs password>
      # It might also need
      #   domain=<windows domain>
      # NOTE: this file *must* have linux style line endings (LF), not Windows
      # style (CR/LF).  If more convenient, you could install dos2unix as part
      # of the apt-get install step, and then pass the credentials file though
      # that (dos2unix -n /cifs.credentials /opt/credentials) and then use the
      # converted file for the credentials.
      # You don't *need* to create a credentials file; the settings can be
      # passed on the mount command line (below) as
      # -o username=<user>,password=<password> instead of
      # -o credenitals=/cifs.credentials, but this exposes the username and
      # password to a greater degree.  You can mount multiple shares by having
      # multiple credential files and multiple mount directories and mount
      # commands.
      - C:\cifs.credentials:/cifs.credenitals
      # Instead of using the standard import and export mounts, you could
      # comment out these lines and add just after the mount command something
      # like

      #   ln -s /data/export /export &&
