Customizing WSI DeID
====================

There are several ways to customize the installation of WSI DeID to change its behavior to better match your desired workflow and use case.

See the files ``devops/wsi_deid/docker-compose.example.local.yml`` and ``devops/wsi_deid/girder.local.conf`` for comments about many of these options.  Broadly, the options in ``devops/wsi_deid/docker-compose.example.local.yml`` change the deployment environment, such as directories that are used and available memory.  The options in ``devops/wsi_deid/girder.local.conf`` change the run-time behavior, such as how label and macro images are redacted.

When modifying ``devops/wsi_deid/girder.local.conf``, you'll also need to enable using the custom file by uncommenting a few lines as described in ``devops/wsi_deid/docker-compose.example.local.yml``.

Settings in girder.local.conf
-----------------------------

The WSI DeID specific settings are in a section headed by ``[wsi_deid]``.

Redacting the top/left of the macro image
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

When the ``redact_macro_square`` setting is set to ``True``, the upper left square of all macro images will automatically be blacked out.  This region often contains the label on the slide, and sometimes that can contain PHI that is visible with contrast or other image adjustment.

Redaction Catgories
+++++++++++++++++++

By default, when metadata or images are redacted, the user must pick the type of PHI/PII that is present and the reason for the redaction.  If the ``require_redact_category`` is set to ``False``, then, instead of requiring a reason, the user interface will show a ``REDACT`` button that toggles redaction on and off for the metadata or image.  The export file will contain ``No Reason Collected`` in these cases.

Redacting the Label Image
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The label image can be redacted by default if the ``always_redact_label`` value is set to ``True``.  If the label image is redacted, it is replaced with a black square with the output filename printed in it.  The label image is not redacted, the output filename is added to the top of the image.

Disabling the Redaction Control
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Redaction can be disabled for certain metadata fields. This can be used for fields that are helpful to users reviewing images, but will never contain actual PHI/PII. This can be configured on a per-format basis. In order to specify which fields should have redaction disabled, add those fields, as regular expressions, to the following lists:

* ``no_redact_control_keys``
* ``no_redact_control_keys_format_aperio``
* ``no_redact_control_keys_format_hamamatsu``
* ``no_redact_control_keys_format_philips``

Note that fields specified in ``no_redact_control_keys`` will have redaction disabled on all image formats. If you wish to disable redaction of a metadata field on, for example, Aperio images only, you can add that value to the ``no_redact_control_keys_format_aperio`` list.

Hiding Metadata Fields
++++++++++++++++++++++

If you wish to hide certain metadata fields because they will never contain PHI/PII and are not useful to reviewers, you can specify those metadata fields, as regular expressions, in the following lists in ``girder.local.conf``:

* ``hide_metadata_keys``
* ``hide_metadata_keys_format_aperio``
* ``hide_metadata_keys_format_hamamatsu``
* ``hide_metadata_keys_format_philips``
