Glossary of Terms
-----------------

This glossary contains technical terms for those wishing to learn more; understanding these terms is not necessary for usage of the WSI DeID.

* Docker - An open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. The WSI DeID is packaged as several Docker containers, which eases installation and distribution of the application. More precisely, Docker uses the term ``images`` for artifacts that are distributed and uses the term ``containers`` for running instances of those images. See `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/install/>`_.
* Docker-Compose - A scripting environment for composing individual Docker services together into a larger application. Used by the WSI DeID as an installation and deployment tool. See `docker-compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`_.
* Git - A distributed source control tool, used for tracking changes to the source code of a computer program.
* GitHub - A public website (https://github.com/) hosting Git repositories, with rich functionality for managing the software development lifecycle.
* YAML - A recursive acronym that stands for YAML Ain't Markup Language. It is a human friendly (or at least engineer friendly) data serialization standard for all programming languages, often used for storing configuration information.
