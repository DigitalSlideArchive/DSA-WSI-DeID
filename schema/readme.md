## Schema

We are expecting a CSV file or XLS file to be uploaded along with the whole slide imaging data.  We are going to use a JSON based schema to validate that all the fields 
are in the proper format.

### Field Set for import files

Each file should consist of the filename, and the following fields.

Column	Variable Name	Variable Type	Variable Coding	Variable Instructions	Example
## TokenID
Alphanumeric	2-digit numeric code for registry + 8-character alphanumeric code for subject + 2-digit numeric Tumor_Rec_Number	Will come prepopulated by IMS. This ID should be used when communicating with IMS, in the Subject Manifest and Transfer Log, and in the file names for the pathology reports and the WSIs.	1234AB567001
## Proc_Seq	Numeric	01, 02, 03, 04	Sequence number of the procedure for the subject	01
C	Proc_Type	Categorical	Biopsy	Indicates the procedure type for the slides (i.e. biopsy, cytology cell block, resection, etc.)	Biospy
			Cytology Cell Block

##	Slide_ID	
\tNumeric	01, 02, 03, â€¦, 20	Indicates the sequence of the slides for a given subject across all specimens	01
F	ImageID	Alphanumeric	TokenID_	Concatenation of TokenID, Proc_Seq, and Slide_ID	1234AB567001_01_01
			Proc_Seq_		
			Slide_ID		
G	**PostDSAStatus	Categorical	Quarantine	Autogenerated/populated by DSA Workflow Report Generator
